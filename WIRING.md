# Component wiring for the payload
This document specifies the pins which are used for various components on the
Raspberry Pi in the AROWSS (Automatic Remote Onboard Wireless Streaming System)
payload. Pinout references can be found on [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/).

All pins are listed as GPIO pins, not board pins.
